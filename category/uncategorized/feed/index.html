<p>Legislature:</p>
<p>HOUSE TAKES AIM AT SUNSCREEN BANS: The House Local, Federal and Veterans Affairs Committee will consider a proposal (HB 113), filed by Rep.

The issue centers on a decision by Key West to ban certain types of sunscreen because of concerns that they could damage coral reefs. (9 a.m., 12 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>LAWMAKERS LOOK TO CURB VIOLENT THREATS: Sen. Keith Perry, R-Gainesville, and Rep. Mike Beltran, R-Lithia, will take part in a news conference to discuss legislation (SB 1416 and HB 951) that seeks to curb violent threats against transit workers. (9:30 a.m., fourth floor, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>ANIMAL CREMATION AT ISSUE: The Senate Agriculture Committee will take up a bill (SB 1282), filed by Sen. Gayle Harrell, R-Stuart, that would place regulations on animal-cremation services. (10 a.m., 301 Senate Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>

Debbie Mayfield, R-Rockledge, that would allow shoppers to avoid paying sales taxes on hunting and fishing gear on Sept. 5.

<p>‘TOBACCO 21’ MEASURE CONSIDERED: The Senate Health Policy Committee will consider a proposal (SB 810), filed by Sen. David Simmons, R-Altamonte Springs, that is known as the “Tobacco 21” bill.

(12:30 p.m., 12 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>PROFESSIONAL REGULATIONS TARGETED: The House Business &amp; Professions Subcommittee and the Senate Innovation, Industry and Technology Committee will take up bills (HB 1193 and SB 474), filed by Rep.

<p>PHYSICIAN TITLES ON AGENDA: The House Health Care Appropriations Subcommittee will take up a bill (HB 309), filed by Rep. Ralph Massullo, R-Lecanto, that would lead to penalties for non-physicians who use titles that could indicate they are doctors. The issue stems from a decision by the Florida Board of Nursing to allow an advanced practice registered nurse to identify himself as a “nurse anesthesiologist” without facing repercussions. (12:30 p.m., 404 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>LICENSE PLATE PROPOSALS CONSIDERED: The House Transportation &amp; Infrastructure Subcommittee will consider a proposal (HB 1135), filed by Rep.

<p>BROADBAND STUDY SOUGHT: The House Government Operations &amp; Technology Appropriations Subcommittee will take up a bill (HB 9221), filed by Rep. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point, that seeks $500,000 for a study of broadband service and infrastructure. (1:30 p.m., Morris Hall, House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>SCHOOL SAFETY ON AGENDA: The Senate Education Committee will take up a bill (SPB 7040) that would address concerns of a grand jury that found “systemic” school-safety failures in Florida. The bill would make several changes to training requirements in the controversial school “guardian” program, increase oversight for districts’ school security plans and make changes to the state’s emergency drill policies. For example, it would require sheriff’s offices to “review and approve” psychological evaluations, drug-test results and background checks of school employees before they can be trained to carry guns in schools as part of the guardian program. In a December report, the grand jury found some school employees completed the state-funded guardian training only to later be told they could not participate in the program “due to defects in their background, psychological evaluations, or due to the failure in some other aspect of the vetting” process. (2:30 p.m., 412 Knott Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>UNIVERSITY FACILITY NAMING CONSIDERED: The Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee will consider a proposal (SB 7042) that would require the state university system’s Board of Governors to adopt regulations about the naming or renaming of facilities. The bill also would remove the name of former Florida Supreme Court Justice B.K. Roberts from a Florida State University College of Law building. That proposal stems from a controversy about pro-segregation opinions that Roberts wrote in the 1950s. (2:30 p.m., 301 Senate Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS AT ISSUE: The House Health Market Reform Subcommittee will take up a bill (PCB HMR 20-02) that would place new requirements on pharmacy benefit managers as part of an effort to hold down prescription-drug costs. (3 p.m., 306 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>DFS CHANGES CONSIDERED: The House Insurance &amp; Banking Subcommittee will consider a proposal (HB 1077), filed by Rep. Chip LaMarca, R-Lighthouse Point, that would make a series of changes related to the Department of Financial Services. (3 p.m., 404 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>PRISON HEALTH CARE DISCUSSED: The House Justice Appropriations Subcommittee will receive a presentation on a study about health care in the prison system. (3 p.m., Morris Hall, House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>SCHOOL BOARD TERM LIMITS PROPOSED: The House PreK-12 Innovation Subcommittee will take up a proposed constitutional amendment (HJR 157), filed by Rep. Anthony Sabatini, R-Howey-in-the-Hills, and Rep. Matt Willhite, D-Wellington, that seeks eight-year term limits for members of county school boards. (3 p.m., Reed Hall, House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>VACATION RENTAL REGULATION DEBATED: The House Workforce Development &amp; Tourism Subcommittee will consider a bill (HB 1011), filed by Rep. Jason Fischer, R-Jacksonville, that would take away power from cities and counties to regulate vacation rental properties. The bill would “preempt” regulation of vacation rentals to the state. Supporters of such preemption point, at least in part, to the property rights of people who decide to use platforms such as Airbnb to rent out homes or parts of homes. But critics contend that such rentals, in many cases, have turned into commercial operations in residential areas. (3 p.m., 12 House Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>SOCIAL MEDIA AT ISSUE: Sen. Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, will hold a news conference about legislation (SB 1266) dubbed the “Stop Social Media Censorship Act.” (3 p.m., fourth floor, the Capitol.)</p>

Joe Gruters, R-Sarasota, that would revamp laws dealing with people who seek homestead tax exemptions while also owning property in other states. (4:30 p.m., 301 Senate Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>BOTTLED WATER FEES SOUGHT: The Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee will take up a bill (SB 1098), filed by Sen. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, that would require bottled water companies to pay fees on water drawn from Florida sources. (4:30 p.m., 37 Senate Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>PUBLIC CAMPAIGN FINANCING OPPOSED: The Senate Ethics and Elections Committee will consider a proposed constitutional amendment (SJR 1110), filed by Chairman Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, that seeks to repeal the public campaign-financing system available to statewide political candidates. (4:30 p.m., 412 Knott Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>‘PIP’ REPEAL PROPOSED: The Senate Infrastructure and Security Committee will take up a bill (SB 378), filed by Chairman Tom Lee, R-Thonotosassa, that seeks to repeal the state’s longstanding no-fault auto insurance system. The system requires motorists to buy personal-injury protection, or PIP, coverage. (4:30 p.m., 110 Senate Office Building, the Capitol.)</p>
<p>RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS EYED: The House Select Committee on the Integrity of Research Institutions will receive an overview of “foreign corruption of U.S. research institutions.” Speaker Jose Oliva, R-Miami Lakes, formed the select committee after the resignation of officials at Moffitt Cancer Center because of issues involving work in China.

<p>The launch of <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/5g/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5G</a> iPhones this year will help 2020 device growth, predicts Gartner, before the decline returns next year.</p>
<p>Gartner’s annual <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-01-21-gartner-forecasts-global-device-shipments-will-grow-0">global device forecast</a> aims to predict shipments for all sizes of computing devices, from smartwatches to PCs. The company says that this year will see a rare return to growth…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Worldwide shipments of devices — PCs, tablets and mobile phones — will total 2.16 billion units in 2020, an increase of 0.9% from 2019, according to Gartner, Inc. In 2019, global shipments of devices totaled 2.15 billion units.</p>
<p>“2020 will witness a slight market recovery,” said Ranjit Atwal, research senior director at Gartner. “Increased availability of 5G handsets will boost mobile phone replacements, which will lead global device shipments to return to growth in 2020.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The global devices market has been in decline as a slower pace of technological development sees people hold onto their existing devices for longer.</p>
<p>The biggest growth will be in smartphones, thanks to demand for 5G models.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The worldwide mobile phone market is on course to grow by 1.7% in 2020 […] Shipments of smartphones were weak in 2019, recording a 2% decline year over year, but are expected to grow in 2020, particularly in Greater China and emerging markets in Asia/Pacific.</p>
<p>Gartner estimates that 5G models will account for 12% of mobile phone shipments in 2020, and that will reach 43% by 2022.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s partly a factor of more brands offering 5G models – with Apple the headline news here – and partly due to better 5G coverage. The availability of 5G connectivity is currently extremely limited, with the faster mmWave service mostly only available at the busiest locations in larger cities: major public transit hubs, sports stadiums, and tourist attractions.</p>
<p>2020 device growth will be short-lived, however. Gartner expects the decline to resume from 2021, though falling 5G phone prices will help buoy the smartphone market.</p>
<p>The PC market did see a boost in 2019, thanks to Microsoft announcing the end of support for Windows 7, prompting upgrades. Increased demand for Windows machines saw <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/13/idc-gartner-pc-mac-sales-q4-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac market share fall</a>.</p>
